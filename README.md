Done in html canvas, this is a whole lot of chickens that will run from the cursor. Here's the whole monstrosity: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kelvinperrie/herdem/blob/master/examples/examples.html

Getting the basic flee working; each blue square has a red square that is the destination it is fleeing too:

A whooooole lot of squares

Chickens instead of squares. An improvement?
